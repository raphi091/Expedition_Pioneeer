Although this asset has two set of heads, it still uses unity humanoid rig with its animations imported as separate files.
By default, the left head is the one used in the humanoid rig setup.

To control the animations, use Animator Controller object. Sample of controller can be found in Demo folder.

If performance is your main concern, rescale the textures and change the materials type.
