Thanks for downloading Fantasy Music Collection! This pack contains 20 full loopable 
tracks (WAV & MP3 files), featuring several variations of the tracks, 
which gives you 44 audio files. 


I hope these tracks serve your Fantasy, RPG game well! I'd love to know 
when & how you use this music so I can share your game with my audience!

If you have any questions or would like to hire me to compose custom music for your game,
